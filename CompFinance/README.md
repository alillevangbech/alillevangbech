## **Computational Finance** #
This folder contains a small collection of methods - all implemented in C++. It mainly relates to analytical and Monte Carlo pricing of European options. Furthermore, there's examples of Finite Differences and Parallelized Monte Carlo.

For my "Computational Finance" and "Continuous Time Finance" courses my professors  liked building excel add-ins with C++ code behind it. The method behind it is in "ExortingCpp2xl.pdf". It basically just allows you to transfer functions from C++ to Excel.


1. **Project1**

    A project for testing out building upon existing RNG (Randonm Number Generators) in the standard library. Furthermore, Black-Scholes pricing is included - both analytical and Monte-Carlo. Same goes for the Heston model.

2. **Project2**

    A project for pricing under the CEV model. It uses FDM pricing and standard Monte Carlo, along with parallized Monte Carlo. The setup for parallized Monte Carlo is taken from "Modern Computational Finance: AAD and Parallel Simulations" by Antoine Savine. It's compiled into an Excel add-in. 
    
3. **Project3**
    A project for pricing under Bachelier, Black-Scholes,Merton and SABR. Done with either Monte Carlo, analytical or approximations to analytical formulas.
    It's compiled into an Excel add-in.
