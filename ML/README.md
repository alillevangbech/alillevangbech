## **Machine Learning** #
This folder contains a small collection of ML algorithms I've implemented. Any work on neural networks has been in tensorflow and is located in my SABR_representation folder.

#### C++ Programs
I've implemented K-Nearest Neighbour and Logistic Regression in C++. The primary reason for doing this was to test out the Armadillon linear algebra library, and make sure that I was able to seamlessly read online documentation of the library and use it effectivly.


#### R programs
For the R projects, using Rstudio is recommended to view graphs. All data needed to run the R programs is located in the data folder. 

1. **Project1 (K-Nearest Neighbour)**

    K-Nearest Neighbour on the MINST dataset. Big dataset, so depending on the computer, it might take between 10-30 min to run.

2. **Project2 (Linear Regression)**

    Basic Linear Regression implentation used on DanWood dataset.
    
3. **Project3 (Logistic Regression)**

      Implentation of Logistic Regression on the IRIS dataset.

4. **Project4 (Principal component analysis)**
